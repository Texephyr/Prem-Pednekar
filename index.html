        <h3>Ishaan Awasthi is an eight-year-old child. His world is filled with wonders that no one else seems to appretiate are just not important in the world of adults, who are much more interested in things like homework, marks and neatness.
             And Ishaan just cannot seem to get anything right in class. With no friends and Teachers always complaining about him, he is dejected. 
             When he gets into far more trouble than his parents can handle, he is packed off to a boarding school to 'be disciplined'. 
             Things are no different at his new school, and Ishaan has to contend with the added trauma of separation from his family. He doesn't like the school at all.
              One day a new art teacher bursts onto the scene, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, who infects the students with joy and optimism. 
              He breaks all the rules of 'how things are done' by asking them to think, dream and imagine, and all the children respond with enthusiasm, all except Ishaan.
               Nikumbh soon realizes that Ishaan is very unhappy, and he sets out to discover why. With time, patience and care, he ultimately helps Ishaan find himself.
            As a result Nikumbh completely tranforms Ishaan into a completely new version of himself which his parents, teachers, friends, never even though of happening.

        <h3><span>#</span>Aamir Khan received special permission from Amitabh Bachchan to use Abhishek Bachchan's experiences in the film. The reference is made in terms of Abhishek being one of the most successful stars and how he came to star in the blockbuster Dhoom (2004), overcoming the dyslexia that he had during childhood.<span>#</span></h3>
        <h3><span>#</span>When Rajan and Ishaan are talking in the corridors, Rajan says he lives in the staff quarters as opposed to in the normal student dorm. Later on, Ram asks Rajan where Ishaan is, and Rajan says he saw him leave the student dorm early. If Rajan lived in the staff quarters, he wouldn't know this.<span>#</span></h3>
        <h3><span>#</span>The opening credits rolls after few minutes of the film and consists of animated sequences (in order to portray the main character's imaginary world).<span>#</span></h3>
